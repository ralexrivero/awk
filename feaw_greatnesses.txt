GREAT are the myths, I too delight in them,
Great are Adam and Eve, I too look back and
accept them,
Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets,
women, sages, inventors, rulers, warriors,
priests.

Great is liberty! Great is equality! I am their
follower,
Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where
you sail, I sail!
Yours is the muscle of life or death, yours is the
perfect science, in you I have absolute faith.

Great is today, and beautiful,
It is good to live in this age, there never was any
better.

Great are the plunges, throes, triumphs, falls of
democracy,
Great the reformers, with their lapses and screams,
Great the daring and venture of sailors on new
explorations.
